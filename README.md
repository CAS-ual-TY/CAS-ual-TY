### Minecraft Mods

I have been creating Minecraft mods since I am 11 years of age. They range from smaller utility mods to sophisticated magical systems. The corresponding CurseForge page is linked in each repository. Please refer to those for a more accurate description.

You can also see an overview on my CurseForge page: https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/cas_ual_ty/projects

#### YgoDuelingMod
The Ygo Dueling Mod for Minecraft aims to reflect the real life TCG experience in a 3D open world game by not only adding the cards but also the packs and their pull ratios to the game.
